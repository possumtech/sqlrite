# sqlrite Contributor Code of Conduct

sqlrite is an open source project and not a community. It exists to perform the
technical goals outlined in the readme and implemented in the codebase. All
contributors are equally welcome, except from those who reject the premise that
Sqlrite is an open source project and not a community.

Those seeking a "community" are encouraged to reach out to a local church,
mosque, temple, synagogue, or local civic organization, at your discretion, for
community support. sqlrite does not support or endorse any cause or campaign.

Conversations on the platform are to pertain to the project. All other topics
are unwelcome.
